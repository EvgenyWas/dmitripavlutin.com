Before [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) object literals (also named object initializers) in JavaScript were quite elementary. It was possible to define 2 types of properties:

- Pairs of property names and related values `{ name1: value1 }`
- [Getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) `{ get name(){..} }` and [setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) `{ set name(val){..} }` for computed property values

Sadly, the object literal possibilities match into a single example:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  myString: 'value 1',
  get myNumber() {
    return this._myNumber;
  },
  set myNumber(value) {
    this._myNumber = Number(value);
  },
};
myObject.myString; // => 'value 1'
myObject.myNumber = '15';
myObject.myNumber; // => 15
```

JavaScript is a [prototype based language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming), so everything is an object. It is a must that language to provide easy constructs when it comes to objects creation, configuration and accessing prototypes.

It's a common task to define an object and setup it's prototype. I always felt that setting up the prototype should be allowed directly in the object literal, using a single statement.

Unfortunately the limitations of the literal didn't allow to achieve that with a straightforward solution. You had to use `Object.create()` in combination with the object literal to setup the prototype:

```javascript
var myProto = {
  propertyExists: function(name) {
    return name in this;
  },
};
var myNumbers = Object.create(myProto);
myNumbers['array'] = [1, 6, 7];
myNumbers.propertyExists('array'); // => true
myNumbers.propertyExists('collection'); // => false
```

In my opinion, it's an uncomfortable solution. JavaScript is prototype based, why so much pain to create objects from a prototype?

Fortunately the language is changing. Many things that were relatively frustrating in JavaScript are solved step by step.

This article demonstrates how ES2015 solves the problems described above and improves the object literal with additional goodies:

- Setup the prototype on object construction
- Shorthand method declarations
- Make `super` calls
- Computed property names

Also let's look in the future and meet the new proposals ([at stage 2](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread#status-of-this-proposal)): rest and spread properties of an object.

## 1. Setup the prototype on object construction

As you know already, one option to access the prototype of an existing object is applying the getter property `__proto__`:

```javascript
var myObject = {
  name: 'Hello World!',
};
myObject.__proto__; // => {}
myObject.__proto__.isPrototypeOf(myObject); // => true
```

`myObject.__proto__` returns the prototype object of `myObject`.

Notice that the usage of `object.__proto__` as a getter/setter is not recommended. Alternatives `Object.getPrototypeOf()` and `Object.setPrototypeOf()` should be considered instead.

The good part is that [ES2015 allows to use](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-__proto__-property-names-in-object-initializers) the literal `__proto__` as the property name to setup the prototype right in the object literal `{ __proto__: protoObject }`.

Let's use `__proto__` property for an object initialization, and improve the bitter situation that was described in the introduction:

```javascript
var myProto = {
  propertyExists: function(name) {
    return name in this;
  },
};
var myNumbers = {
  __proto__: myProto,
  array: [1, 6, 7],
};
myNumbers.propertyExists('array'); // => true
myNumbers.propertyExists('collection'); // => false
```

`myNumbers` object is created with the prototype `myProto` using a special property name `__proto__`.  
The object is created in a single statement, without additional functions like `Object.create()`.

As seen, coding with `__proto__` is simple. I always prefer simple and obvious solutions.

A bit out of theme. I consider an oddity that simple and flexible solutions require a big amount of work and design. If a solution is simple, you may consider that it was easy to design it. However it's vice versa:

- To make it simple and straightforward is complicated
- To make it complex and hard to understand is easy

If something looks too complex or not comfortable to use, probably it wasn't considered enough.  
What is your opinion about simplicity? (feel free to write a comment below)

### 2.1 Special cases of \_**\_proto\_\_** usage

Even if `__proto__` seems simple, there are some particular scenarios that you should be aware of.

![Infographic](./images/proto.jpg)

It is allowed to use `__proto__` **only once** in the object literal. On duplication JavaScript throws an error:

```javascript
var object = {
  __proto__: {
    toString: function() {
      return '[object Numbers]'
    }
  },
  numbers: [1, 5, 89],
  __proto__: {
    toString: function() {
      return '[object ArrayOfNumbers]'
    }
  }
};
```

The object literal in the example is using two times `__proto__` property, which is not allowed. An error `SyntaxError: Duplicate __proto__ fields are not allowed in object literals` is thrown in this situation.

JavaScript constraints to use only an object or `null` as a value for `__proto__` property. Any attempt to use primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans) or `undefined` is simply ignored and does not change object's prototype.  
Let's see this limitation in an example:

```javascript
var objUndefined = {
  __proto__: undefined,
};
Object.getPrototypeOf(objUndefined); // => {}
var objNumber = {
  __proto__: 15,
};
Object.getPrototypeOf(objNumber); // => {}
```

The object literals are using `undefined` and number `15` to setup `__proto__` value. Because only an object or `null` are allowed to be prototypes, `objUndefined` and `objNumber` still have their default prototypes: plain JavaScript objects `{}`. The `__proto__` value is ignored.

Of course, it would be weird to attempt to use primitive types to setup object's prototype. The constraint applied here is expected.

Also be careful when the object literal has a computed property name that evaluates to `'__proto__'` string: `{ ['__proto__']: protoObj }`. The property created such way does not change object's prototype, but simply creates an owned property with the key `'__proto__'`.

## 2. Shorthand method definition

It is possible to use a shorter syntax to declare methods in object literals, in a way that `function` keyword and `:` colon to be omitted. This is named shorthand method definition.

Let's define some methods using the new short form:

```javascript
var collection = {
  items: [],
  add(item) {
    this.items.push(item);
  },
  get(index) {
    return this.items[index];
  },
};
collection.add(15);
collection.add(3);
collection.get(0); // => 15
```

`add()` and `get()` are methods defined in `collection` using a short form.

A nice benefit is that methods declared this way are named functions, which is useful for debugging purposes. Executing `collection.add.name` from previous example returns the function name `'add'`.

## 3. Make super calls

An interesting improvement is the ability to use `super` keyword as way to access inherited properties from the prototype chain. Take a look at the following example:

```javascript
var calc = {
  numbers: null,
  sumElements() {
    return this.numbers.reduce(function(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    });
  },
};
var numbers = {
  __proto__: calc,
  numbers: [4, 6, 7],
  sumElements() {
    // Verify if numbers is not null or empty
    if (this.numbers == null || this.numbers.length === 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    return super.sumElements();
  },
};
numbers.sumElements(); // => 17
```

`calc` is the prototype of `numbers` object. In the method `sumElements` of the `numbers` it is possible to access the methods from the prototype using `super` keyword: `super.sumElements()`.  
This is a method override.

Eventually `super` is a shortcut to access the inherited properties from the prototype chain of the object.

In the previous example you may try to call the prototype directly executing `calc.sumElements()`. However `super.sumElements()` is a correct option because it accesses the prototype chain of the object. And makes sure that `sumElements()` method from the prototype accesses correctly the array using `this.numbers`.  
`super` presence clearly suggests that inherited properties are about to be used.

### 3.1 super usage restriction

`super` can be used **only inside the shorthand method definition** in an object literal.

If trying to access it from a normal method declaration `{ name: function() {} }`, JavaScript throws an error:

```javascript
var calc = {
  numbers: null,
  sumElements() {
    return this.numbers.reduce(function(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    });
  },
};
var numbers = {
  __proto__: calc,
  numbers: [4, 6, 7],
  sumElements: function() {
    // Verify if numbers is not null or empty
    if (this.numbers == null || this.numbers.length === 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    return super.sumElements();
  },
};
// Throws SyntaxError: 'super' keyword unexpected here
numbers.sumElements();
```

The method `sumElements` is defined as a property: `sumElements: function() {...}`. Because `super` requires to be used only inside shorthand methods, calling it in such situation throws `SyntaxError: 'super' keyword unexpected here`.

This restriction does not affect much the way object literals are declared. Mostly is preferable to use shorthand method definitions because of a shorter syntax.

## 4. Computed property names

Before ES2015, the property names in object initializers were literals, mostly static strings. To create a property with calculated name, you had to use property accessors:

```javascript
function prefix(prefStr, name) {
  return prefStr + '_' + name;
}
var object = {};
object[prefix('number', 'pi')] = 3.14;
object[prefix('bool', 'false')] = false;
object; // => { number_pi: 3.14, bool_false: false }
```

Certainly, this way to define properties is by far pleasant.

Computed property names solves the problem elegantly.
When evaluating the property name from an expression, place the code into square brackets `{[expression]: value}`. The expression evaluation result becomes the property name.

I really like the syntax: short and simple.

Let's improve the above example:

```javascript
function prefix(prefStr, name) {
  return prefStr + '_' + name;
}
var object = {
  [prefix('number', 'pi')]: 3.14,
  [prefix('bool', 'false')]: false,
};
object; // => { number_pi: 3.14, bool_false: false }
```

`[prefix('number', 'pi')]` sets the property name by evaluating `prefix('number', 'pi')` expression, which is `'number_pi'`.  
Correspondingly `[prefix('bool', 'false')]` sets the second property name to `'bool_false'`.

### 4.1 Symbol as property name

[Symbols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) also can be used as computed property names. Just make sure to include them in brackets: `{ [Symbol('name')]: 'Prop value' }`.

For example, let's use the special property `Symbol.iterator` and iterate over the own property names of an object. Check the following example:

```javascript
var object = {
   number1: 14,
   number2: 15,
   string1: 'hello',
   string2: 'world',
   [Symbol.iterator]: function *() {
     var own = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(this),
       prop;
     while(prop = own.pop()) {
       yield prop;
     }
   }
}
[...object]; // => ['number1', 'number2', 'string1', 'string2']
```

`[Symbol.iterator]: function *() { }` defines a property that is used to iterate over owned properties of the object. The spread operator `[...object]` uses the iterator and returns the list of owned properties.

## 5. A look into the future: rest and spread properties

[Rest and spread properties](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread) of the object literal are a proposal in draft (stage 2), which makes them a candidate for a new JavaScript version.

They are an equivalent of [the spread and rest operator](/how-three-dots-changed-javascript/#4-improved-array-manipulation) already available for arrays in ECMAScript 2015.

[Rest properties](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread/blob/master/Rest.md) allows to collect the properties from an object that are left after a destructuring assignment.  
The following example collects the remaining properties after destructuring `object`:

```javascript
var object = {
  propA: 1,
  propB: 2,
  propC: 3,
};
let { propA, ...restObject } = object;
propA; // => 1
restObject; // => { propB: 2, propC: 3 }
```

[Spread properties](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread/blob/master/Spread.md) allows to copy into an object literal the owned properties from a source object.
In this example the object literal collects into `object` additional properties from `source` object:

```javascript
var source = {
  propB: 2,
  propC: 3,
};
var object = {
  propA: 1,
  ...source,
};
object; // => { propA: 1, propB: 2, propC: 3 }
```

## 6. In conclusion

JavaScript is making big steps.

Even a relatively small construct as object literal was considerable improved in ECMAScript 2015. And a bunch of new features are in draft proposal.

You can setup the object's prototype directly from the initiliazer using `__proto__` property name. Which is easier than dealing with `Object.create()`.

Notice that `__proto__` is a part of the [annex B](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-additional-ecmascript-features-for-web-browsers) of the ES2015 standard, which usage is discouraged. This annex implementation is required for browsers, but optional for other environments.  
NodeJS 4, 5 and 6 however support this feature.

The method declaration has now a shorter form, so you don't have to type `function` keyword. And inside shorthand method it's possible to use `super` keyword, which allows easy access to inherited properties from the prototype chain of the object.

If a property name is calculated on runtime, now you can use computed property names `[expression]` to initialize objects.

Indeed, object literals are now cool!
