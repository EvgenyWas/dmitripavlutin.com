Users enjoy fast and responsive user interfaces (UI). A UI response delay of fewer than 100 milliseconds feels instant to the user. But a delay between 100 and 300 milliseconds is already perceptible.  

To improve user interface performance, React offers a higher-order component `React.memo()`. When `React.memo()` wraps a component, React memoizes the rendered output of the wrapped component and then skips unnecessary renderings.  

This post describes the situations where `React.memo()` improves the performance, and, not less importantly, warns when its usage is useless.  

In addition, I'll describe some useful memoization tips you should be aware of.  

## 1. React.memo()

When deciding to update DOM, React first renders your component, then compares the result with the previous render. If the render results are different, React updates the DOM.  

The current vs the previous render results comparison is fast. But you can *speed up* the process under some circumstances.  

When a component is wrapped in `React.memo()`, React renders the component and memoizes the result. Before the next render, if the new props are the same, React reuses the memoized result, *skipping the next rendering*.  

Let's see the memoization in action. The functional component `Movie` is wrapped in `React.memo()`:  

```jsx
export function Movie({ title, releaseDate }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Movie title: {title}</div>
      <div>Release date: {releaseDate}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export const MemoizedMovie = React.memo(Movie);
```

`React.memo(Movie)` returns a new memoized component `MemoizedMovie`. 

`MemoizedMovie` outputs the same content as the original `Movie` component, but with one difference &mdash; `MemoizedMovie` render is memoized. React reuses the memoized content as long as `title` and `releaseDate` props are the same between renderings:  

```jsx{2-3,8-9}
// First render - MemoizedMovie IS INVOKED.
<MemoizedMovie 
  title="Heat" 
  releaseDate="December 15, 1995" 
/>

// Second render - MemoizedMovie IS NOT INVOKED.
<MemoizedMovie
  title="Heat" 
  releaseDate="December 15, 1995" 
/>
```

[Open the demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-memo-demo-c9dx1), then expand the console. You will see that React renders `<MemoizedMovie>` (memoized) just once, while `<Movie>` (non-memoized) re-renders every time.  

You gain a *performance boost*: by reusing the memoized content, React skips rendering the component and doesn't perform a virtual DOM difference check.  

The same functionality for class components is implemented by [PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent).  

### 1.1 Custom equality check of props

By default `React.memo()` does a [shallow](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v16.8.6/packages/shared/shallowEqual.js) comparison of props and objects of props. 

To customize the props comparison, you can use the second argument to indicate an equality check function:  

```javascript
React.memo(Component, [areEqual(prevProps, nextProps)]);
```

`areEqual(prevProps, nextProps)` function must return `true` if `prevProps` and `nextProps` are equal.

For example, let's manually calculate if `Movie` component props are equal:

```jsx
function moviePropsAreEqual(prevMovie, nextMovie) {
  return prevMovie.title === nextMovie.title
    && prevMovie.releaseDate === nextMovie.releaseDate;
}

const MemoizedMovie2 = React.memo(Movie, moviePropsAreEqual);
```

`moviePropsAreEqual()` function returns `true` if prev and next props are equal.

### 2.1 Component renders often with the same props

The best case of wrapping a component in `React.memo()` is when you expect the component to render often and usually with the same props.  

A common situation that makes a component render with the same props is being forced to render by a parent component.  

Let's reuse `Movie` component defined above. A new parent component `MovieViewsRealtime` displays the number of views of a movie, with real-time updates:  

```jsx{3}
function MovieViewsRealtime({ title, releaseDate, views }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Movie title={title} releaseDate={releaseDate} />
      Movie views: {views}
    </div>
  );
}
```
The application regularly polls the server in the background (every second), updating `views` property of `MovieViewsRealtime` component.  

```jsx{2,9,16}
// Initial render
<MovieViewsRealtime 
  views={0} 
  title="Forrest Gump" 
  releaseDate="June 23, 1994" 
/>

// After 1 second, views is 10
<MovieViewsRealtime 
  views={10} 
  title="Forrest Gump" 
  releaseDate="June 23, 1994" 
/>

// After 2 seconds, views is 25
<MovieViewsRealtime 
  views={25} 
  title="Forrest Gump" 
  releaseDate="June 23, 1994" 
/>

// etc
```

[Try the demo.](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-memo-no-memoization-06vp1y?file=/src/index.js:152-187)

Every time `views` prop is updated with a new number, `MovieViewsRealtime` renders. This triggers `Movie` rendering too, even if `title` and `releaseDate` remain the same.  

This is the appropriate case for applying memoization to `Movie` component.  

Let's use the memoized component `MemoizedMovie` inside `MovieViewsRealtime` to prevent useless re-renderings:

```jsx{3}
function MovieViewsRealtime({ title, releaseDate, views }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <MemoizedMovie title={title} releaseDate={releaseDate} />
      Movie views: {views}
    </div>
  )
}
```

[Try the demo.](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-memo-memoization-uxhnuv?file=/src/index.js)

As long as `title` and `releaseDate` props remain the same, React skips rendering `MemoizedMovie`. This improves the performance of `MovieViewsRealtime` component.  

> The more often the component renders with the same props, the heavier and the more computationally expensive the output is, the more chances are that component needs to be wrapped in `React.memo()`.  

Anyways, use [profiling](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-devtools-profiler) to measure the benefits of applying `React.memo()`.   

## 3. When to avoid React.memo()

> If the component *isn't heavy* and usually *renders with different props*, most likely you don't need `React.memo()`.  

Use the following rule of thumb: don't use memoization if you can't quantify the performance gains. 

> Performance-related changes applied incorrectly can even harm performance. Use `React.memo()` wisely.  

Although possible, wrapping class-based components in `React.memo()` is undesirable. Extend `PureComponent` class or define a custom implementation of `shouldComponentUpdate()` method if you need memoization for class-based components.  

### 3.1 Useless props comparison

Imagine a component that usually renders with different props. In this case, memoization doesn't provide benefits. 

Even if you wrap such a volatile component in `React.memo()`, React does 2 jobs on every rendering:

1. Invokes the comparison function to determine whether the previous and next props are equal
2. Because props comparison almost always returns `false`, React performs the diff of previous and current render results

You gain no performance benefits, have more complex code (than the non-memoized version), and also run the comparison function.   

## 4. React.memo() and callback functions

The function object equals only to itself. Let's see that by comparing some functions:

```javascript{7}
function sumFactory() {
  return (a, b) => a + b;
}

const sum1 = sumFactory();
const sum2 = sumFactory();

console.log(sum1 === sum2); // => false
console.log(sum1 === sum1); // => true
console.log(sum2 === sum2); // => true
```

[Try the demo.](https://jsfiddle.net/dmitri_pavlutin/zhL6pf7t/)

`sumFactory()` is a factory function. It returns functions that sum 2 numbers.  

The functions `sum1` and `sum2` are created by the factory. Both functions sum numbers. However, `sum1` and `sum2` are different function objects (`sum1 === sum2` is `false`).  

Every time a parent component defines a callback for its child, it creates new function instances. Let's see how this breaks memoization, and how to fix it.   

The following component `Logout` accepts a callback prop `onLogout`:

```jsx
function Logout({ username, onLogout }) {
  return (
    <div onClick={onLogout}>
      Logout {username}
    </div>
  );
}

const MemoizedLogout = React.memo(Logout);
```

A component that accepts a callback must be handled with care when applying memoization. The parent component could provide different instances of the callback function on every render:  

```jsx{6}
function MyApp({ store, cookies }) {
  return (
    <div className="main">
      <header>
        <MemoizedLogout
          username={store.username}
          onLogout={() => cookies.clear('session')}
        />
      </header>
      {store.content}
    </div>
  );
}
```
Even if provided with the same `username` value, `MemoizedLogout` renders every time because it receives new instances of `onLogout` callback.  

Memoization is broken.  

To fix memoization, `onLogout` prop must receive the same callback instance. Let's apply [useCallback()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecallback) to preserve the callback instance between renderings:

```jsx{3-6,12}
const MemoizedLogout = React.memo(Logout);

function MyApp({ store, cookies }) {
  const onLogout = useCallback(
    () => cookies.clear('session'), 
    [cookies]
  );
  return (
    <div className="main">
      <header>
        <MemoizedLogout
          username={store.username}
          onLogout={onLogout}
        />
      </header>
      {store.content}
    </div>
  );
}
```

`useCallback(() => cookies.clear('session'), [cookies])` always returns the same function instance as long as `cookies` is the same. The memoization of `MemoizedLogout` is fixed.  

## 5. React.memo() is a performance hint

Strictly, React uses memoization as a performance hint. 

Although React avoids rendering a memoized component in most situations, you shouldn't count on it to prevent rendering.  

## 6. React.memo() and hooks

Components that use hooks can be freely wrapped in `React.memo()` to achieve memoization.

React always re-renders the component when the state changes, even if the component is wrapped in `React.memo()`.  

## 7. Conclusion

`React.memo()` is a great tool to memoize functional components. When applied correctly, it prevents useless re-renderings when previous props equal to current props.  

Take precautions when memoizing components that use props as callbacks. Be sure to provide the same callback function instance between renderings.  

Don't forget to use [profiling](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-chrome-performance-tab) to measure the performance gains of memoization.
