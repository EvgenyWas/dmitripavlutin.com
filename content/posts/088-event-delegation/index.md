## 1. Why event delegation?

Let's log a message to the console when an HTML button is clicked.  

To make it work, you need to select the button, then use `addEventListener()` method to attach an event listener:

```html{4}
<button id="buttonId">Click me</button>

<script>
  document.getElementById('buttonId')
    .addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Clicked!'));
</script>
```

That's the way to go to listen for events on a single element, particularly a button.   

What about listening for events on multiple buttons? Here's a <span id="many-event-listeners">possible implementation</span>:

```html{9-12}
<div id="buttons">
  <button class="buttonClass">Click me</button>
  <button class="buttonClass">Click me</button>
  <!-- buttons... -->
  <button class="buttonClass">Click me</button>
</div>

<script>
  const buttons = document.getElementsByClassName('buttonClass');
  for (const button of buttons) {
    button.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Clicked!'));
  }
</script>
```

Take a look at the [Codesandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/infallible-archimedes-6feob?file=/index.html) to see how it works.  

The buttons list is iterated `for (const button of buttons)` and a new listener is attached to each button. Also, when a button is added or removed from the list, you'd have to manually remove or attach event listeners.  

Is there a better approach?

Fortunately, when using the *event delegation* pattern, listening for events on multiple elements requires just one event listener.  

The event delegation uses specifics of *event propagation* mechanism. To understand how event delegation works, I recommend understanding the event propagation first.   

## 2. Event propagation

When you click the button in the following HTML:

```html{3}
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="buttons">
      <button class="buttonClass">Click me</button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

On how many elements a click event gets triggered? Without a doubt, the button itself receives a click event. But also... all button's ancestors and even the `document` and `window` objects.  

A click event propagates in 3 phases: 

1. *Capture phase* &mdash; Starting from `window`, `document` and the root element, the event dives down through ancestors of the target element
2. *Target phase* &mdash; The event gets triggered on the element on which the user has clicked
3. *Bubble phase* &mdash; Finally, the event bubbles up through ancestors of the target element until the root element, `document`, and `window`.  

![JavaScript Event Propagation](./images/javascript-event-propagation-5.png)

The third argument `captureOrOptions` of the method:

```javascript
element.addEventListener(eventType, handler[, captureOrOptions]);
``` 

lets you catch events from different phases.

* If `captureOrOptions` argument is missing, `false` or `{ capture: false }`, then the listener captures the events of *target and bubble phases*
* If the argument is `true` or `{ capture: true }`, then the listener listens for events of *capture phase*.  

The following event handler listens for click events in capture phase occured on `<body>` element:

```javascript{2}
document.body.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('Body click event in capture phase');
}, true);
```

In this [Codesandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/event-propagation-example-71yvl?file=/src/index.js), when clicking the button, you can see in console how the event propagates.  

Ok, how does event propagation help capturing events of multiple buttons? 

The algorithm is simple: attach the event listener to the parent of buttons, and catch the bubbling event when a button is clicked. This is exactly how event delegation works.  

## 3. Event delegation

Let's use the event delegation to catch clicks on multiple buttons:

```html
<div id="buttons"> <!-- Step 1 -->
  <button class="buttonClass">Click me</button>
  <button class="buttonClass">Click me</button>
  <!-- buttons... -->
  <button class="buttonClass">Click me</button>
</div>

<script>
  document.getElementById('buttons')
    .addEventListener('click', event => { // Step 2
      if (event.target.className === 'buttonClass') { // Step 3
        console.log('Click!');
      }
    });
</script>
```

Open the [Codesandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/event-delegation-example-6y6gc?file=/index.html) and click any button &mdash; you'll see `'Click!'` message logged to console.  

The idea of event delegation is simple. Instead of attaching the event listeners directly to the buttons, you *delegate* listening to the parent `<div id="buttons">`. When a button is clicked, the listener of the parent element catches the *bubbling event* (recall the event propagation?).   

Using the event delegation requires 3 steps:

#### Step 1. Determine the parent of elements to watch for events

In the example above, `<div id="buttons">` is the parent element of the buttons.  

#### Step 2. Attach the event listener to the parent element

`document.getElementById('buttons') .addEventListener('click', handler)` attaches the event listener to the parent element of buttons. This listener reacts to buttons clicks because the *button click event bubbles through ancestors* (thanks to the event propagation).  

#### Step 3. Use *event.target* to select the target element

When a button is clicked, the handler function is invoked with an argument: the `event` object. The property `event.target` is the element upon which the event has been dispatched, which in the example is a button: 

```javascript{2}
  // ...
  .addEventListener('click', event => {
    if (event.target.className === 'buttonClass') {
      console.log('Click!');
    }
  });
```

As a side note, `event.currentTarget` points to the element to which the event listener is attached directly. In the example, `event.currentTarget` is `<div id="buttons">`.  

Now you can see the benefit of the event delegation pattern: *instead of attaching listeners to every button* like it was done [earlier](#many-event-listeners), thanks to event delegation *just one event listener is necessary*.  

## 4. Summary

When a click event happens (or any other event that propagates):

* The event travels down from `window`, `document`, root element and through the ancestors of the target element (capture phase)
* The event occurs on the target (the target phase) 
* Finally, the event bubbles up through the target's ancestors until the root element, `document` and `window` (the bubble phase).  

This mechanism is named *event propagation*.

The event delegation is a useful pattern because you can listen for events on multiple elements using one event handler.  

Making the event delegation work requires 3 steps:

1. Determine the parent of elements to watch for events
2. Attach the event listener to the parent element
3. Use `event.target` to select the target elements
