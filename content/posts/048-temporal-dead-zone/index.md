Let me ask you a simple question. Which of the following code snippets will generate an error?

The first one that creates an instance, then defines the used class:

```javascript
new Car('red'); // Does it work?

class Car {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }
}
```

Or the second one that first invokes, then defines the function?

```javascript
greet('World'); // Does it work?

function greet(who) {
  return `Hello, ${who}!`;
}
```

The correct answer: the first snippet, the one with a class, generates a `ReferenceError`. The second works correctly.

If your answer is different than the above, or you made a guess without knowing what happens under the hood, then you need to grasp the _Temporal Dead Zone_ (TDZ).

TDZ manages the availability of `let`, `const`, and `class` statements. It is important to how variables work in JavaScript.

## 1. What is _Temporal Dead Zone_

Let's start with a simple `const` variable declaration. If you first declare and initialize the variable, then access it, everything works as expected:

```javascript
const white = '#FFFFFF';

white; // => '#FFFFFF'
```

Now let's try to access `white` variable before declaration:

```javascript{0}
white; // throws `ReferenceError`

const white = '#FFFFFF';

white;
```

In the lines of code until `const white = '#FFFFFF'` statement, the variable `white` is in Temporal Dead Zone.

Having `white` accessed in TDZ, JavaScript throws `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'white' before initialization`.

> _Temporal Dead Zone_ semantics forbids accessing a variable before its declaration. It enforces the discipline: _don't use anything before declaring it_.

## 2. Statements affected by TDZ

Let's see the statements affected by TDZ.

### 2.1 _const_ variables

As seen already, `const` variable is in TDZ before the declaration and initializtion line:

```javascript{1}
// Does not work!
pi; // throws `ReferenceError`

const pi = 3.14;
```

You have to use `const` variable after the declaration:

```javascript{3}
const pi = 3.14;

// Works!
pi; // => 3.14
```

### 2.2 _let_ variables

`let` declaration statement is as well affected by TDZ until the declaration line:

```javascript{1}
// Does not work!
count; // throws `ReferenceError`

let count;

count = 10;
```

Again, use `let` variable only after the declaration:

```javascript{3,8}
let count;

// Works!
count; // => undefined

count = 10;

// Works!
count; // => 10
```

### 2.3 _class_ statement

As seen in the introduction, you cannot use the `class` before defining it:

```javascript{1}
// Does not work!
const myNissan = new Car('red'); // throws `ReferenceError`

class Car {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }
}
```

To make it work, keep the class usage after its definition:

```javascript{7}
class Car {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
  }
}

// Works!
const myNissan = new Car('red');
myNissan.color; // => 'red'
```

### 2.4 _super()_ inside _constructor()_

If you extend a parent class, before calling `super()` inside the constructor, `this` binding lays in TDZ:

```javascript{2-3,8}
class MuscleCar extends Car {
  constructor(color, power) {
    this.power = power;
    super(color);
  }
}

// Does not work!
const myCar = new MuscleCar('blue', '300HP'); // `ReferenceError`
```

Inside the `constructor()`, `this` cannot be used until `super()` is called.

TDZ suggests calling the parent constructor to initialize the instance. After doing that, the instance is ready, and you can make the adjustments in the child constructor.

```javascript{2-3,8}
class MuscleCar extends Car {
  constructor(color, power) {
    super(color);
    this.power = power;
  }
}

// Works!
const myCar = new MuscleCar('blue', '300HP');
myCar.power; // => '300HP'
```

### 2.5 Default function parameters

The default parameters exist within an intermidiate scope, separated from global and function scopes. The default parameters also follow the TDZ restriction:

```javascript{5}
const a = 2;
function square(a = a) {
  return a * a;
}
// Does not work!
square(); // throws `ReferenceError`
```

The parameter `a` is used on the right side of the expression `a = a`, before being declared. This generates a reference error regarding `a`.

Make sure that the default parameter is used after its declaration and initialization. Let's use a special variable `init` that is initialized before usage:

```javascript{5}
const init = 2;
function square(a = init) {
  return a * a;
}
// Works!
square(); // => 4
```

## 3. _var_, _function_, _import_ statements

Contrary to the statements presented above, `var` and `function` definitions are not affected by TDZ. They are hoisted up in the current scope.

If you access `var` variable before the declaration, you simply get an `undefined`:

```javascript{1}
// Works, but don't do this!
value; // => undefined

var value;
```

However, a function can be used regarding where it is defined:

```javascript{1,8}
// Works!
greet('World'); // => 'Hello, World!'

function greet(who) {
  return `Hello, ${who}!`;
}

// Works!
greet('Earth'); // => 'Hello, Earth!'
```

Often you're not interested much in the function implementation, rather you just want to call it. That's why sometimes it makes sense to invoke the function before defining it.

What's interesting that `import` modules are hoisted too:

```javascript{1}
// Works!
myFunction();

import { myFunction } from './myModule';
```

While `import` hoists, a good practice is to load module's dependencies at the beginning of the JavaScript file.

## 4. _typeof_ behavior in TDZ

`typeof` operator is useful to determine whether a variable is defined within the current scope.

For example, the variable `notDefined` is not defined. Applying `typeof` operator on this variable does not throw an error:

```javascript
typeof notDefined; // => 'undefined'
```

Because the variable is not defined, `typeof notDefined` evaluates to `undefined`.

But `typeof` operator has a different behavior when used with variables in a Temporal Dead Zone. In this case, JavaScript throws an error:

```javascript{0}
typeof variable; // throws `ReferenceError`

let variable;
```

The reason behind this reference error is that you can statically (just by looking at code) determine that `variable` is already defined.

## 5. TDZ acts within the current scope

The Temporal Dead Zone affects the variable within the limits of the scope where the declaration statement is present.

![Limits of Temporal Dead Zone in JavaScript](./images/limits-of-temporal-dead-zone-javascript.png)

Let's see an example:

```javascript{2,5}
function doSomething(someVal) {
  // Function scope
  typeof variable; // => undefined
  if (someVal) {
    // Inner block scope
    typeof variable; // throws `ReferenceError`
    let variable;
  }
}
doSomething(true);
```

There are 2 scopes:

1. The function scope
2. The inner block scope where a `let` variable is defined

In the function scope, `typeof variable` simply evaluates to `undefined`. Here the TDZ of `let variable` statement has no effect.

In the inner scope the `typeof variable` statement, using a variable before the declaration, throws an error `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'variable' before initialization`. TDZ exists within this inner scope only.

## 6. Conclusion

TDZ is an important concept that affects the availability of `const`, `let`, and `class` statements. It doesn't allow to use the variable before the declaration.

Contrary, `var` variables inherit an older behavior when you can use the variable even before the declaration. You should avoid doing that.

In my opinion, TDZ is one of those good things when good coding practices reach into the language specification.
