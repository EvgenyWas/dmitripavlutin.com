The plain JavaScript object `{ key: 'value' }` holds structured data. Mostly it does this job well enough.  

But the plain object has a limitation: its keys have to be strings (or rarely used symbols). What happens if you use numbers as keys? Let's try an example:
```javascript
const names = {
  1: 'One',
  2: 'Two',
};

Object.keys(names); // => ['1', '2']
```

The numbers `1` and `2` are keys in `names` object. Later, when the object's keys are accessed, it turns out the numbers were converted to strings.  

Implicit conversion of keys is tricky because you lose the consistency of the types.  

A lot of plain object's issues (keys to string conversion, impossibility to use objects like keys, etc) are solved by [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) object. This post describes the use cases when it's better to use maps instead of plain objects.  

## 1. The map accepts any key type

As presented above, if the object's key is not a string or symbol, JavaScript implicitly transforms it into a string.

Contrary, the map accepts keys of any type: strings, numbers, boolean, symbols. Moreover, the map preserves the key type. That's the map's main benefit.  

For example, if you use a number as a key inside a map, it will remain a number:

```javascript{5}
const numbersMap = new Map();

numbersMap.set(1, 'one');
numbersMap.set(2, 'two');

[...numbersMap.keys()]; // => [1, 2]
```

`1` and `2` are keys in `numbersMap`. The type of the keys remains the same. 

You can also use booleans as keys inside a map:

```javascript{5}
const booleansMap = new Map();

booleansMap.set(true, "Yep");
booleansMap.set(false, "Nope");

[...booleansMap.keys()]; // => [true, false]
```

`booleansMap` uses booleans `true` and `false` as keys. 

Inside a plain object, the use of booleans as keys is impossible. These keys would be transformed into strings: `'true'` or `'false'`.

Can you use further an entire object as a key? Yes, you can. Just be aware of memory leaks.  

## 1.1 Object as key

Let's say you need to store some object-related data, without attaching this data on the object itself. 

Doing so using plain objects is not possible. But there's a workaround: an array of object-value tuples.

```javascript
const foo = { name: 'foo' };
const bar = { name: 'bar' };

const kindOfMap = [
  [foo, 'Foo related data'],
  [bar, 'Bar related data'],
];
```

`kindOfMap` is an array holding pairs of an object and associated value. 

The downside of this approach is the O(n) complexity of accessing the value by key. You have to loop through the entire array to get the desired value:

```javascript 
function getByKey(kindOfMap, key) {
  for (const [k, v] of kindOfMap) {
    if (key === k) {
      return v;
    }
  }
  return undefined;
}

getByKey(kindOfMap, foo); // => 'Foo related data'
```

[WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap) (a specialized version of `Map`) is a better solution:

* `WeakMap` accepts objects as keys
* Allows straightforward access of value by the key, with O(1) complexity  

The above code refactored to use `WeakMap` becomes trivial:

```javascript{8}
const foo = { name: 'foo' };
const bar = { name: 'bar' };

const mapOfObjects = new WeakMap();

mapOfObjects.set(foo, 'Foo related data');
mapOfObjects.set(bar, 'Bar related data');

mapOfObjects.get(foo); // => 'Foo related data'
```

The main difference between `Map` and `WeakMap` is the latter allowing garbage collection of keys (which are objects). This prevents memory leaks.  

`WeakMap`, contrary to `Map`, accepts only *objects as keys* and has a [reduced set of methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap#Methods).

## 2. The map has no restriction over keys names

Any JavaScript object inherits properties from its prototype object. The same happens to plain objects.

The accidentally overwritten property inherited from the prototype is dangerous. Let's study such a dangerous situation.

First, let's ovewrite the `toString()` property in an object `actor`:

```javascript{2}
const actor = {
  name: 'Harrison Ford',
  toString: 'Actor: Harrison Ford'
};
```

Then, let's define a function `isPlainObject()` that determines if the supplied argument is a plain object. This function uses the method `toString()`:

```javascript{10}
function isPlainObject(value) {
  return value.toString() === '[object Object]';
}
```

Finally, lets' call `isPlainObject(actor)`. Here's the problem: because `toString` property inside `actor` is a string (instead of an expected function), this call generates an error:

```javascript
// Does not work!
isPlainObject(actor); // TypeError: value.toString is not a function
```

When the application input is used to [create the keys names](#21-real-world-example), you have to use a map instead of a plain object to avoid the problem described above.

The map doesn't have any restrictions on the keys names. You can use keys names like `toString`, `constructor`, etc. without consequences:

```javascript{10}
function isMap(value) {
  return value.toString() === '[object Map]';
}

const actorMap = new Map();

actorMap.set('name', 'Harrison Ford');
actorMap.set('toString', 'Actor: Harrison Ford');

// Works!
isMap(actorMap); // => true
```

Regardless of `actorMap` having a property named `toString`, the method `toString()` works correctly.  

### 2.1 Real world example

When the user input creates keys on objects? Let's analyze a case.  

Imagine a User Interface that manages custom fields. The user can add a custom field by specifying its name and value:

![Custom fields User Interface](./images/custom-fields-2.png)

It would be convenient to store the state of the custom fields into a plain object:

```javascript{3}
const userCustomFields = {
  'color':    'blue',
  'size':     'medium',
  'toString': 'A blue box'
};
```

But the user can choose a custom field name like `toString` (as in the example), `constructor`, etc. As presented above, such keys names on the state object could potentially break the code that later uses this object. 

*Don't take user input to create keys on your plain objects!*  

Because the map has no restrictions over the keys names, the right solution is to bind the user interface state to a map.  

```javascript
const userCustomFieldsMap = new Map([
  ['color', 'blue'],
  ['size', 'medium'],
  ['toString', 'A blue box']
]);
```

There is no way to break the map, even using keys as `toString`, `constructor`, etc.

## 3. The map is iterable

To iterate plain object's properties are necessary static functions like `Object.keys()` or `Object.entries()` (available in ES2017) .  

For example, let's iterate over the keys and values of `colorsHex` object:

```javascript{5}
const colorsHex = {
  'white': '#FFFFFF',
  'black': '#000000'
};

for (const [color, hex] of Object.entries(colorsHex)) {
  console.log(color, hex);
}
// 'white' '#FFFFFF'
// 'black' '#000000'
```

`Object.entries(colorsHex)` returns an array of key-value pairs extracted from the object.

Access of keys-values of a map is more comfortable because the map is iterable. Anywhere an iterable is accepted, like `for()` loop or spread operator, use the map directly.

`colorsHexMap` keys-values are iterated directly by `for()` loop:

```javascript{5}
const colorsHexMap = new Map();

colorsHexMap.set('white', '#FFFFFF');
colorsHexMap.set('black', '#000000');

for (const [color, hex] of colorsHexMap) {
  console.log(color, hex);
}
// 'white' '#FFFFFF'
// 'black' '#000000'
```

`colorsHexMap` is iterable. You can use it anywhere an iterable is accepted: `for()` loops, spread operator `[...map]`.  

Moreover, `map.keys()` returns an iterator over keys and `map.values()` over values.  

## 4. Map's size

You cannot easily determine the number of properties in a plain object. 

One workaround is to use a helper function like `Object.keys()`:

```javascript
const exams = {
  'John Smith': '10 points',
  'Jane Doe': '8 points',
};

Object.keys(exams).length; // => 2
```

`Object.keys(exams)` returns an array with keys of `exams`. The size of `exams` is the number of keys this array contains.  

The map provides a better alternative. The property `map.size` indicates the number of keys-values.

Let's see how to use `size` on `examsMap`:

```javascript
const examsMap = new Map([
  ['John Smith', '10 points'],
  ['Jane Doe', '8 points'],
]);
  
examsMap.size; // => 2
```

It's simple to determine the size of the map: `examsMap.size`.  

## 5. Conclusion

Plain JavaScript objects do the job of holding structured data. But they have some limitations:

1) Only strings or symbols can be used as keys
* Own object properties might collide with property keys inherited from the prototype (e.g. `toString`, `constructor`, etc). 
* Objects cannot be used as keys

These limitations are solved by maps. Moreover, maps provide benefits like being iterators and allowing easy size look-up.  

Anyways, don't consider maps as a replacement of plain objects, but rather a complement.
