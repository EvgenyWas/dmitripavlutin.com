JavaScript offers a bunch of useful array methods to check whether an array contains a particular value.  

While searching for primitive value like number or string is relatively easy, searching for objects is slightly more complicated.  

In this post, you will read about how to determine if an array contains a particular value, being a primitive or object.  

## 1. Array contains a primitive value

A primitive value in JavaScript is a string, number, boolean, symbol, and special value `undefined`.  

The easiest way to determine if an array contains a primitive value is to use `array.includes()` ES2015 array method:

```javascript
const hasValue = array.includes(value[, fromIndex]);
```

The first argument `value` is the value to search in the array. The second, optional, argument `fromIndex` is the index from where to start searching. The method returns a boolean indicating whether `array` contains `value`.   

For example, let's determine whether an array of greeting words contains the values `'hi'` and `'hey'`:

```javascript
const greetings = ['hi', 'hello'];

greetings.includes('hi');  // => true
greetings.includes('hey'); // => false
```

`greetings.includes('hi')` returns `true` because the array contains `'hi'` item.  

But `greetings.includes('hey')` returns `false`, denoting that `'hey'` is missing in the `greetings` array.  

### 1.1 Searching from an index

`array.includes(value, fromIndex)` also accepts an optional second argument to start search for value starting an index.  

For example, let's start searching from the second item (index `1` and up) in the array:

```javascript
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];

letters.includes('c', 1); // => true
letters.includes('a', 1); // => false
```

`letters.includes('c', 1)` starts searching for `'c'` letter from index `1`. As expected, the letter is found.  

However, `letters.includes('a', 1)` returns `false` because the array from index `1` until the end doesn't contain the item `'a'`.  

## 2. Array contains an object

Checking if an array contains an object is slightly more complex than searching for primitive values.   

Determining if an array contains a reference to an object is easy &mdash; just use the `array.includes()` method. For example:

```javascript
const greetings = [{ message: 'hi' }, { message: 'hello' }];

const toSearch = greetings[0];

greetings.includes(toSearch); // => true
```

`greetings.includes(toSearch)` returns `true` because the `greetings` array contains `toSearch` object reference (which points to the first item of the array).  

But more often, instead of searching by reference, you'd like to search for objects by their content. In such a case `array.includes()` won't work: 

```javascript
const greetings = [{ message: 'hi' }, { message: 'hello' }];

const toSearch = { message: 'hi' };

greetings.includes(toSearch); // => false
```

`greetings.includes(toSearch)` returns `false`, because the array doesn't contain `toSearch` object reference. Although the array contains the object `hi` that looks exactly like `toSearch`.  

Ok, so how do you determine if the array contains an object by content, rather than reference? Using `array.some()` method in combination with shallow or deep equality check of objects.  

During *shallow equality* check of objects the list of properties of both objects is checked for equality.  

Here's a possible implementation of shallow equality check:

```javascript
function shallowEqual(object1, object2) {
  const keys1 = Object.keys(object1);
  const keys2 = Object.keys(object2);

  if (keys1.length !== keys2.length) {
    return false;
  }

  for (let key of keys1) {
    if (object1[key] !== object2[key]) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```

`shallowEqual(object1, object2)` returns `true` in case if both compared objects `object1` and `object2` have the same set of properties with the same values.  

In the following code snippet `hi` and `hiCopy` are equal by content, while `hi` and `hello` are not:

```javascript
const hi     = { message: 'hi' };
const hiCopy = { message: 'hi' };
const hello  = { message: 'hello' };

shallowEqual(hi, hiCopy); // => true
shallowEqual(hi, hello);  // => false
```

As a reminder, the array method `array.some(callback)` returns `true` if at least one time `callback` function returns `true`.  

Now, let's use the shallow equality function in combination with `array.some(callback)` method to find if the array contains an object by content:  

```javascript{4}
const greetings = [{ message: 'hi' }, { message: 'hello' }];

const toSearch = { message: 'hi' };

greetings.some(item => shallowEqual(item, toSearch)); // => true
```

`greetings.some(item => shallowEqual(item, toSearch))` checks every item of the array for shallow equality with `toSearch` object.  

If the searched object contains also nested objects, then instead of `shallowEqual()` function you could use the [deepEqual()](/how-to-compare-objects-in-javascript/#4-deep-equality) function.  

## 3. Summary

Searching for a primitive value like string or number inside of an array is simple: just use `array.includes(value)` method.  

Determining if an array contains an object by content needs more moving parts. You have to use `array.some(callback)` method combined with shallow equality check:

```javascript
array.some(item => shallowEqual(item, value));
```

Note that the presented approaches are not the only ones. E.g. for a long time `array.indexOf(value) !== -1` expression (which is slighlty clumsy) has been used to determine if the `array` contains `value`.
