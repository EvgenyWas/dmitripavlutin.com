Every JavaScript developer must know what a closure is. During a JavaScript coding interview there's a good chance you'll get asked about the concept of closures.  

I compiled a list of 7 interesting and increasingly challenging questions on JavaScript closures. 

Take a pencil and a piece of paper, and try to answer the questions without looking at the answers, or running the code. In my estimation, you would need about 30 minutes.  

Have fun!

## Questions 1: Closures raise your hand

Consider the following functions `clickHandler`, `immediate`, and `delayedReload`:

```javascript
let countClicks = 0;
button.addEventListener('click', function clickHandler() {
  countClicks++;
});
```

```javascript
const result = (function immediate(number) {
  const message = `number is: ${number}`;
  return message;
})(100);
```

```javascript
setTimeout(function delayedReload() {
  location.reload();
}, 1000);
```

Which of these 3 functions access outer scope variables?

<details>
  <summary>Expand answer</summary>

1) `clickHandler` *accesses* the variable `countClicks` from the outer scope.  
2) `immediate` *doesn't access* any variables from the outer scope. 
3) `delayedReload` *accesses* the global variable `location` from the global scope (aka the outermost scope).

## Questions 2: Lost in parameters

What will log to console the following code snippet:

```javascript
(function immediateA(a) {
  return (function immediateB(b) {
    console.log(a); // What is logged?
  })(1);
})(0);
```

<details>
  <summary>Expand answer</summary>

`0` is logged to the console. [Try the demo.](https://jsitor.com/_r8I1Do6L)  

`immediateA` is called with the argument `0`, thus `a` parameter is `0`.  

`immediateB` function, being nested into `immediateA` function, is a closure that captures `a` variable from the outer `immediateA` scope, where `a` is `0`. Thus `console.log(a)` logs `0`.  

</details>

## Questions 3: Who's who

What will log to console the following code snippet:

```javascript
let count = 0;
(function immediate() {
  if (count === 0) {
    let count = 1;
    console.log(count); // What is logged?
  }
  console.log(count); // What is logged?
})();
```

<details>
  <summary>Expand answer</summary>

`1` and `0` is logged to the console. [Try the demo.](https://jsitor.com/3c9T0QMAG)

The first statement `let count = 0` declares a variable `count`.  

`immediate()` is a closure that captures the `count` variable from the outer scope. Inside of the `immediate()` function scope `count` is `0`.  

However, inside the conditional, another `let count = 1` declares a local variable `count`, which overwrites `count` from outer the scope. The first `console.log(count)` logs `1`.  

The second `console.log(count)` logs `0`, since here `count` variable is accessed from the outer scope.  

</details>

## Questions 4: Tricky closure

What will log to console the following code snippet:

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(function log() {
    console.log(i); // What is logged?
  }, 1000);
}
```

`3`, `3`, `3` is logged to console. [Try the demo.](https://jsitor.com/8kit3zMOT)

The code snippet executes in 2 phases.  

**Phase 1**  

1. `for()` iterating 3 times. During each iteration a new function `log()` is created, which captures the variable `i`. `setTimout()` schedules `log()` for execution after 1000ms.  
3. When `for()` cycle completes, `i` variable has value `3`.  

**Phase 2**

The second phase happens after 1000ms:

1. `setTimeout()` executes the scheduled `log()` functions. `log()` reads the *current value* of variable `i`, which is `3`, and logs to console `3`.

That's why `3`, `3`, `3` is logged to the console.  

*Side challenge: how would you fix this example to log `0`, `1`, `2` values after passing 1 second? Write your solution in a comment below!*

## Questions 5: Right or wrong message

What will log to console the following code snippet:

```javascript
function createIncrement() {
  let count = 0;
  function increment() { 
    count++;
  }

  let message = `Count is ${count}`;
  function log() {
    console.log(message);
  }
  
  return [increment, log];
}

const [increment, log] = createIncrement();
increment(); 
increment(); 
increment(); 
log(); // What is logged?
```

`'Count is 0'` is logged to console. [Try the demo.](https://jsitor.com/W9goMvJt7)

`increment()` function has been called 3 times, effectively incrementing `count` to value `3`.  

`message` variable exists within the scope of `createIncrement()` function. Its initial value is `'Count is 0'`. However, even if `count` variable has been incremented a few times, `message` variable always holds `'Count is 0'`.  

`log()` function is a closure that captures `message` variable from the `createIncrement()` scope. `console.log(message)` logs `'Count is 0'` to console.  

*Side challenge: how would you fix `log()` function to return the message having the actual `count` value? Write your solution in a comment below!*

## Questions 6: Restore encapsulation

The following function `createStack()` creates instances of stack data structure:

```javascript
function createStack() {
  return {
    items: [],
    push(item) {
      this.items.push(item);
    },
    pop() {
      return this.items.pop();
    }
  };
}

const stack = createStack();
stack.push(10);
stack.push(5);
stack.pop(); // => 5

stack.items; // => [10]
stack.items = [10, 100, 1000]; // Encapsulation broken!
```

The stack works as expected, but with one small problem. Anyone can modify items array directly because `stack.items` property is exposed. 

That's an issue since it breaks the encapsulation of the stack: only `push()` and `pop()` methods should be public, but `stack.items` or any other details shouldn't be accessible.  

Refactor the above stack implementation, using the concept of closure, such that there is no way to access `items` array outside of `createStack()` function scope:  

```javascript
function createStack() {
  // Write your code here...
}

const stack = createStack();
stack.push(10);
stack.push(5);
stack.pop(); // => 5

stack.items; // => undefined
```

<details>
  <summary>Expand answer</summary>

Here's a possible refactoring of `createStack()`:

```javascript
function createStack() {
  const items = [];
  return {
    push(item) {
      items.push(item);
    },
    pop() {
      return items.pop();
    }
  };
}

const stack = createStack();
stack.push(10);
stack.push(5);
stack.pop(); // => 5

stack.items; // => undefined
```

[Try the demo.](https://jsitor.com/Am60z1bCI) 

`items` has been moved to a variable inside `createStack()` scope.   

Thanks to this change, from the outside of `createStack()` scope, there is no way to access or modify `items` array. `items` is now a private variable, and the stack is encapsulated: only `push()` and `pop()` method are public.     

`push()` and `pop()` methods, being closures, capture `items` variable from `createStack()` function scope.

## Questions 7: Smart multiplication

Write a function `multiply()` that multiples 2 numbers:

```javascript
function multiply(num1, num2) {
  // Write your code here...
}
```

If `multiply(num1, numb2)` is invoked with 2 arguments, it should return the multiplication of the 2 arguments. 

But if invoked with 1 argument `const anotherFunc = multiply(num1)`, the function should return another function. The returned function when called `anotherFunc(num2)` performs the multiplication `num1 * num2`.  

```javascript
multiply(4, 5); // => 20
multiply(3, 3); // => 9

const double = multiply(2);
double(5);  // => 10
double(11); // => 22
```

<details>
  <summary>Expand answer</summary>

Here's a possible implementation of `multiply()` function:

```javascript
function multiply(number1, number2) {
  if (number2 !== undefined) {
    return number1 * number2;
  }
  return function doMultiply(number2) {
    return number1 * number2;
  };
}

multiply(4, 5); // => 20
multiply(3, 3); // => 9

const double = multiply(2);
double(5);  // => 10
double(11); // => 22
```

[Try the demo.](https://jsitor.com/k-NwrN59K)

If `number2` parameter is not `undefined`, then the function simply returns `number1 * number2`.  

But if `number2` is `undefined`, it means that `multiply()` function has been called with one argument. In such a case let's return a function `doMultiply()` that when later invoked performs the actual multiplication.  

`doMultiply()` is a closure because it captures `number1` variable from `multiply()` scope.  

</details>

* You have a good understanding of closures if you answered correctly 5 or more questions  
* But you need a good refresher on closures if you answered correctly less than 5 questions. I recommend checking my post [A Simple Explanation of JavaScript Closures](/javascript-closure/).
